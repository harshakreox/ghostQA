the 'Reinstate' action button\n    Then the Application Status should change to 'Reinstated'\n    And the reinstatement process should be triggered\n\n  @positive @integration\n  Scenario: Application

bound in IMS\n    And IMS Status changes to 'Bound'\n    Then the system should fetch the updated IMS status\n    And the Application Status in EOX should change to 'Bound'\n\n  @positive @ui\n
